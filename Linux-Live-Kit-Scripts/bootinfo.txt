Thank you for using mylinux!
Steps to make it bootable from your USB device:

1) Extract the contents of ZIP archive to your USB drive.
   If you are using Windows, you will get for example E:\mylinux\
   You probably already did this, just make sure you extracted
   the archive to your USB drive and not to your local harddisk.

2) Now navigate to directory /mylinux/boot/ on your USB drive.
   In Windows, it will be E:\mylinux\boot\ for example.
   Use explorer or any other file manager for this task.

3) While you're in the boot directory, locate file bootinst.bat
   Run it by doubleclicking it. It will setup your USB to boot.

-- That's it. Your USB device is now ready to boot mylinux.
-- You can safely delete this file (mylinux.txt), it's not needed.
